# This file contains the python (distutils/setuptools) instructions so your
# package can be installed on **any** host system. It defines some basic
# information like the package name for instance, or its homepage.
#
# It also defines which other packages this python package depends on and that
# are required for this package's operation. The python subsystem will make
# sure all dependent packages are installed or will install them for you upon
# the installation of this package.
#
# The 'buildout' system we use here will go further and wrap this package in
# such a way to create an isolated python working environment. Buildout will
# make sure that dependencies which are not yet installed do get installed, but
# **without** requiring adminstrative privileges on the host system. This
# allows you to test your package with new python dependencies w/o requiring
# administrative interventions.

    # The module.at.your.library is the python file within your library, using
    # the python syntax for directories (i.e., a '.' instead of '/' or '\').
    # This syntax also omits the '.py' extension of the filename. So, a file
    # installed under 'example/foo.py' that contains a function which
    # implements the 'main()' function of particular script you want to have
    # should be referred as 'example.foo:main'.

    # the version of bob.
